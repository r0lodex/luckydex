# Option 1: Use a credentials file (recommended for local development)
# Place your google-credentials.json file in the root directory
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=google-credentials.json

# Copy the entire contents of your credentials JSON file as a single-line string
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project",...}'
